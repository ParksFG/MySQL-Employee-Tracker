## Description

This is an employee tracker application made using node and MySQL.  I made this project to practice using MySQL.  It uses a few node packages I've used in the past so the main focus was understanding all the syntax for MySQL.  The purpose of the application is to keep track of your employees.  You can add roles, departments, and more employees and the database will stay up to date.  You can also modify existing employee's profiles.  I learnt a lot about MySQL making this program, and I certainly learned the hardships of getting the syntax correct.
